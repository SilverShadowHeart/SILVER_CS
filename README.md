# SILVER_CS
SILVER_CS is a simulation-based AI scheduler for RTOS, trained on synthetic workloads using semi-supervised learning and curriculum training with a TinyTransformer model. In benchmarks against a simulated VxWorks-like scheduler, it reduced missed deadlines by 13â€“14%, with performance validated via task clustering analysis.
